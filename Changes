- Various changes and refactorings to support both a pure Perl and XS
  backend. MaxMind::DB::Reader::XS is a separate distro on CPAN. If you
  install this it will automatically be used when you use the
  MaxMind::DB::Reader module.

- Added a speed improvement for looking up IPv4 addresses in databases that
  contain both IPv4 and IPv6.

- Made the dump-database script output valid JSON.

- Added a dump-search-tree script.

- Explicitly require Perl 5.10+ for now. Getting this working on 5.8 might be
  possible in the future, and patches are welcome, but it's a fair bit of
  work, starting with getting Socket to support inet_pton on 5.8.x.

- Fixed test failures related to imprecise double storage. On some machines, a
  decoded double may be slightly off from the expected value because of
  floating point precision issues. The tests now just check that the value is
  within 0.001 of what we expect.
